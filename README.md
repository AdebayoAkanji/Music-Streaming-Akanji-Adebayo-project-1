In analysis insight

Since the Premium plan is the highest subscription a dimension of discount should be given to encourage more customers to use this particular plan. the process of activating the premium plan should also be seamless and easy to encourage fast subscription. The payment plan for this subscription type should also be examined to ease off the stress. More attractive and melodious music should be encouraged on this premium plan to boost the customer base.

A dimension of discount can also be encouraged in countries that records low patronage to encourage them. However, this can be done in a strategic manner.

Amazon Music is the platform mostly used for streaming by most of the existing customers. This application needs to be well organized and readily available for users so as to encourage continuous patronage.

Reggae music and jazz music are the highest genre listened to by most customers thus music of this dimension should be published and easy access granted so at to encourage continuous patronage. meanwhile, other music genre with low turnout should be published free at certain time or for a period in order to encourage more user for them.

Based on the high patronage from the Australian residents, discounts should be introduced to encourage them and challenge users from other country. If there’s any technique used in Australia, such technique should be replicated in other states to encourage patronage. More awareness and advertisements need to be encouraged in areas of low patronage so as to get more customers.
